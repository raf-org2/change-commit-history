## Step 2: Removing a file from Git history using BFG Repo-Cleaner

_You did TBD-step-1-name! :tada:_

Now that we've deleted the file, people that browse the repository on GitHub.com or anyone looking at just the head commit won't see the file. However, due to Git's nature, the file is still present in the history. In this step, we'll work on removing the file from the repository history.

There are multiple tools available for removing Git history, we'll use BFG Repo-Cleaner in this step. You can find additional documentation on [Using the BFG in GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository#using-the-bfg).
